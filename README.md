# lsci-mcx-sims
Repository to generate MCX/PyMCX simulations for speckle contrast imaging settings

## Requirements
The only required dependency for pmcx is numpy. Additional (and optional) modules can be installed, including

    jdata, for saving simulations to human-readable JSON/NeuroJSON files, also for importing MCX .jnii/.jdat/.jdt output files
    bjdata, for saving simulations to more compact binary JSON files, also for importing MCX .bnii/.jdb output files
    matplotlib, for plotting and visualization of the data
